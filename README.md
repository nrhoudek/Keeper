# Keeper
Keeper is an app made with the React.js front-end framework. This app allows you to add notes, ideas, tasks, and anything else one may need. These notes may then be deleted when no longer needed. 

IMPORTANT: Unfortunately, this app is not connected to a database, so all the notes will be removed whenever the app is closed or refreshed.
