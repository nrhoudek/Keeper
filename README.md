# Keeper

This Keeper apps works similiar to a notebook. It allows you to add a note and then delete it whenever you do not need it anymore. 

This app was created with React.js and it's purpose was to help me learn React.js.

IMPORTANT: Unfortunately, this app is not connected to a database, so all the notes will be removed whenever the app is closed or refreshed.
